:::info

Please refer to [this section](/docs/installation/payment-provider#recurring-payments) for the requirements for enabling subscription (recurring) payments

:::

### Donation type

Change the donation types available for your donors. Three options are available:
- **One-off** - Single (one-off) payments only
- **Subscription** - Recurring payments only
- **Both** - Allow the donor to chose from either of the above types

## Payment

### Payment type

Chose how donors can specify the amount they would like to donate. There are three possible options:
- **Open** - Allow the donor to manually enter the amount they would like to donate
- **Fixed** - Restrict the amount to pre-defined amounts (see below)
- **Both** - Allow the donor to chose from the fixed amounts but also enable manual entry

### Fixed amounts

If using either **Open** or **Both** **Payment type** you can define the fixed amounts you would like the donor to be able to chose from. You can enter either whole numbers with major units (5,10,20) or whole numbers with minor units (5.5, 10.2, 20.25). You can enter a maximum of 5 fixed values. 

### Minimum allowed donation

This is the minimum donation that will be accepted.

### Maximum donation

The maximum donation that you want to allow, leave blank to disable. This does not override your payment provider's maximum.
