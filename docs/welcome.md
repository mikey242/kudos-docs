# Welcome

My name is Michael. I studied Wildlife Biology but have always had an interest in technology and computing.

I started working on **Kudos Donations** during the Covid pandemic as a way of helping the cultural sector, which at that time were my main clients, get support from their communities and supporters. In fact the name **"Kudos"** originally came from the portmanteau **"CuDo"** meaning **Cultural Donations**. Realizing this sounded a lot like kudos and that kudos means recognition or praise for an achievement **Kudos Donations** eventually won out.
