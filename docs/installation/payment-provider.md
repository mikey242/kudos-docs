# Payment Provider

Once you have [installed](./install.md) and activated Kudos Donations, the next step is to enable a payment provider. At the moment we only support Mollie, however we are planning on adding more in the future.

## Mollie

:::tip

You can get your Mollie API keys by visiting [this page](https://mollie.com/dashboard/developers/api-keys).

:::

Visit the new **Donations** menu in the WordPress admin, you will be greeted by a welcome guide which will help you to get up and running. The main thing that you will need to complete here is to enter your **Mollie API keys** so that Kudos Donations can communicate with your Mollie account. You will need both your **test** and **live** keys.
