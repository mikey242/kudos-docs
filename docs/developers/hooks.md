# Hooks

Hooks are features supported by WordPress that allow you to interact with or modify parts of the plugin without editing the code of the plugin. This ensures that when the plugin is updated, your modifications will still be present.

:::info

More information about hooks can be found in the WordPress developer documentation found [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/)

:::

Hooks are divided into two main categories:
- Actions - allow you to **add** features or data at specific points of the plugin
- Filters - allow you to **modify** parts of the plugin (such as text)
